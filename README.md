tls
=======

** PS: All encryption is done using other libraries. This project is to impliment the tls protocol as defined in rfc 5246.

Step 1 : Extract definitions from rfc5246
Step 2 : Parse the definitiosn
Step 3 : Emit C#(or any other language) to be used in the server
Step 4 : Use the generated code to consume tls messages

Steps 1 and 2 has been done
Step 3 needs to be extends to other languaes other than c#
Step 4 , well this is just a sample implimentation
